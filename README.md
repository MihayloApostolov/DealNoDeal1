# DealNoDeal 
This is a small little game I made for a school assignment. 
It is modeled after a popular tv show in which contestants pick and swap boxes with monetary or other prizes, ranging from 0.5 to 100k BGN,
and the box that they are left with after opening all other boxes contains the prize they win.
It is made as a WPF app. And i had a lot of fun building it.
